Installation
------------

To use SCOOTI, first install it using pip:

.. code-block:: console

   (venv) $ pip install git+https://github.com/dwgoblue/SCOOTI.git --upgrade

.. note::  Cobratoolbox is required for SCOOTI to model contrained and unconstrained models. The instruction of cobratoolbox and its installation can be found `<https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/installation.html>`_. In addition, optimization solvers are required for cobratoolbox. We recommend Gurobi solver for the linear version of iMAT and MOOMIN, and CPLEX 20.0.1 for COMPASS. 



Modeling Metabolic States
-------------------------

Constrained and unconstrained models are required for SCOOTI to infer metabolic objectives. In this section, we will demonstrate how to use a MATLAB function `multiObj_CBM` to generate these two types of models in bash files.
